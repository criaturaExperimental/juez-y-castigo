# Juez y castigo
This project was a stage setup for a kid show.

[Demo here](https://criaturaexperimental.github.io/juez-y-castigo/)

## How to play around with this project?
- Use "a" and "d" keys to activate one judge or another.
- "w" key mute both judges.

## The original challenge
Challenge was to make something **interactive** for the sound operator in order to make the judges *talk*, syncing their mouths with the host dialogue. This should be able to run in a quite outdated OS with very limited resources. So I came out with this fix, in the shape of a little web app that was running smoothly for the whole season.
