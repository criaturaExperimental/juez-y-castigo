# Juez y castigo
This project was a stage setup for a kid show.

Challenge was to make something interactive for the sound operator in order to make the judges "talk" syncing their mouths with the host dialogue and able to run in a quite outdated OS with very limited resources. So I came out with this fix in the shape of a little web app that was running smoothly for the whole season.
